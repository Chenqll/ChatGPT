Chen ask: What is love?
---------------
CQL_ChatGPT reply :

My dear Lord,
The love which is in you now,
When it is the sight of men's eyes.

It is to me that the word is once more sweet
For all mankind that were born and died.

I once did hear it said: 'Love me if thou art with me,
For love is the most important thing in life.'

This saying, when spoken of one's heart,
For which I have been most hu##mble,
Is a true love-song?

A true love-song is the song of love:
And it is, indeed, like that of love,
Which the heart of man sings;
...
And the love of his words is the love of his life.

---------------
Chen ask: How to say love to someone?
---------------
CQL_ChatGPT reply : Have fun with the words.

Love is not so much a feeling that we have, but a substance that we feel. Like a substance, love must be experienced, created and then relinquished. Love can exist between two people, or between two strangers. But it takes work to have a good relationship, and we can't spend much time in a bad relationship.

When it comes to love, we can't always let a relationship slide and call it a day.

Chen ask: AI is stupid?
---------------
CQL_ChatGPT reply : Have any of the developers responded? If we can get so many people to come together around such a stupid idea why is no one else doing it? Do we really need a good way to find people who can help with security? Or to figure out how to fix the problems that we have? I would say that it is the latter reason that is the true "killjoy" of the project.
